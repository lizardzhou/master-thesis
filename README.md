Master thesis including UDF and post-processing for CFD simulation of a spray drying process

UDF: user-defined function for ANSYS Fluent solver
1. UDF for defining diffusivity of continuous phase
2. UDF for defining DPM heat and mass transfer, moisture content, relative drying rate and diameter based on drying kinetics

Post-processing programms written in MATLAB for data generated from simulation
